Hopefully it now works correctly.
Testing some stuff because stuff. Testing some stuff because stuff. Testing some stuff because stuff. Testing some stuff because stuff.

```java
private int i = 5;
private final Stuff stuff = new Stuff();

public Potato() {
	this.i = 5000;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
	List<String> list = Arrays.asList(args);
	list.forEach(System.out::println);
	System.out.println("Does this have the correct style?");
}
```
Using *emphasis* on **words**. Cool stuff.
